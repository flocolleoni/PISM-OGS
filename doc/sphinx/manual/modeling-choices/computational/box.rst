Computational box
-----------------

PISM performs all simulations in a computational box which is rectangular in the PISM
coordinates. The coordinate system has horizontal coordinates `x,y` and a vertical
coordinate `z`. The `z` coordinate is measured positive upward from the base of the ice.\
[#]_ The vector of gravity is in the negative `z` direction. The surface `z=0` is the base
of the ice, however, and thus is usually not horizontal in the sense of being parallel to
the geoid.

The surface `z=0` is the base of the ice both when the ice is grounded and when the ice is
floating.

When the ice is grounded, the true physical vertical coordinate `z'`, namely the
coordinate measured relative to a reference geoid, is given by

.. math::
   z' = z + b(x,y),

where `b(x,y)` is the bed topography. The top surface of the ice `h(x,y)` is described by
`h(x,y) = H(x,y) + b(x,y)`, where `H(x,y)` is the ice thickness.

In the floating case, the physical vertical coordinate is

.. math::
   :label: eq-vertical-coordinate

   z' = z + z_{sl} - \frac{\rho_i}{\rho_w} H(x,y)

where `\rho_i` is the density of ice, `\rho_w` the density of sea water, and `z_{sl}` is
the sea level elevation. Again, the physical elevation of the bottom (top) surface of the
ice relative to the geoid can be computed by substituting `z = 0` (`z = H(x,y)`) in
:eq:`eq-vertical-coordinate`.

Here the *flotation criterion* `z_{sl} - \frac{\rho_i}{\rho_w} H(x,y) > b(x,y)` applies.

The computational box can extend downward into the bedrock. As `z=0` is the base of
the ice, the bedrock corresponds to negative `z` values regardless of its true (i.e.
`z'`) elevation.

The extent of the computational box, along with its bedrock extension downward, is
determined by four numbers ``Lx``, ``Ly``, ``Lz``, and ``Lbz`` (see
:numref:`fig-rectilinearbox` and :numref:`tab-compbox`). The first two of these are
half-widths and have units of kilometers when set by command-line options or displayed.

   * - Option
     - Description
   * - :opt:`-Lx` (km)
     - Half-width of the computational domain (in the `x`\-direction)
   * - :opt:`-Ly` (km)
     - Half-width of the computational domain (in the `y`\-direction)
   * - :opt:`-Lz` (meters)
     - Height of the computational domain; must exceed maximum ice thickness
   * - :opt:`-Lbz` (meters)
     - Depth of the computational domain in the bedrock thermal layer
   * - :opt:`-x_range A,B` (meters)
     - Specify the range of `x` coordinates. Use this to select a subset of an input grid
       that isn't in the center of a domain.
   * - :opt:`-y_range A,B` (meters)
     - Specify the range of `y` coordinates.

See :ref:`sec-grid-registration` for details about the interpretation of `L_x`, `L_y`, and
the way the grid spacing is computed.
