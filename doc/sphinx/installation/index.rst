Installing PISM
+++++++++++++++

The fastest path to a fully functional PISM installation is to use a Linux system with a
Debian- or Arch Linux-based package system (e.g. Ubuntu_). In Debian and derivatives,
start by following subsection :ref:`sec-install-debian`, to install tools and libraries
used by PISM and then :ref:`sec-install-pism` to install PISM itself. In Arch Linux and
derivatives, follow the instructions in subsection :ref:`sec-install-arch`.
